The implementation was crafted to match the design spec as closely as possible. All fonts, colors, images, and visual styles were discovered through careful research (no input from the designer was given; only the [graphic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spiritphyz/2016-09-twittler/master/design-spec/design-spec.png?token=AHitc_8XhpEk6GotHryvjfR8HNLitAbVks5X0O2hwA%3D%3D) was available for reference).

Several helper libraries were used to achieve the visual components of the spec:
 * [Jdenticon](https://github.com/dmester/jdenticon) and [js-md5](https://github.com/emn178/js-md5) for custom user avatars
 * [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) glyphs, [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) typefaces
 * [Moment.js](https://github.com/moment/moment) for relative times

 Twittler is the capstone project of Hack Reactor Fulcrum.

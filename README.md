# Twittler

A simpler Twitter-style message board that uses locally-generated random tweets.

The implementation was crafted to match the design spec as closely as possible. All fonts, colors, and images were discovered through careful research (no input from the designer was given, only the graphic was available for reference).

Several helper libraries were used to achieve the components in the spec:
 * Jdenticon and MD5 for custom user avatars
 * FontAwesome glyphs, Google Fonts typefaces
 * Moment.js for relative times

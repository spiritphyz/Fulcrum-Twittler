# Twittler

### A simple Twitter-style message board that creates the sayings of today's generation.

My version of [Twittler](http://spiritphyz.io/twittler/) was crafted to match the design spec as closely as possible. All fonts, colors, images, and visual styles were discovered through careful research (no input from the designer was given; only the [graphic](https://github.com/spiritphyz/Fulcrum-Twittler/blob/master/design-spec/design-spec.png) was available for reference).

Several helper libraries were used to achieve the visual components of the spec:
 * [Jdenticon](https://github.com/dmester/jdenticon) and [js-md5](https://github.com/emn178/js-md5) for custom user avatars
 * [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) glyphs, [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) typefaces
 * [Moment.js](https://github.com/moment/moment) for relative times

Twittler is the capstone project of [Hack Reactor Fulcrum](http://fulcrum.reactorcore.com/).
